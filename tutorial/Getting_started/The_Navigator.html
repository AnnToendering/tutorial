## The Navigator

The `<ons-navigator>` is used for stack based navigation in Onsen UI apps.

This is a very common type of navigation in mobile apps where one page is pushed on top of another using a transition animation.

In this section we will also take a look at the `<ons-template>` element which is used to create the pages for the navigator.
